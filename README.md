# Unexpected 'this' Keyword Behavior in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a common source of confusion in JavaScript: the dynamic nature of the `this` keyword.  The example showcases how the value of `this` changes depending on how a function is called.

## The Problem

In JavaScript, the value of `this` is not statically bound to the function definition. Instead, it's determined at runtime based on how the function is invoked.

The provided `bug.js` file shows a scenario where the expected behavior of `this` might not be as intuitive.  This can lead to unexpected results and bugs in your code, especially if you're not accustomed to this behavior.

## The Solution

The solution, provided in `bugSolution.js`, demonstrates how to solve this by using techniques like explicit binding (`bind`, `call`, `apply`) to ensure that `this` has the expected value.  Explicitly setting `this` prevents unexpected behavior and makes your code more robust.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` to view the problematic code and the solution.
3. Use a JavaScript runtime environment (Node.js, browser console, etc.) to run the code and observe the differences.

This example helps you better understand and manage the `this` keyword in JavaScript, avoiding common pitfalls.
